Meh, more boring stuff. I guess.

# whoami

I am a student software developer and an aspiring writer from New Delhi, India. I am currently pursuing my B.S. in Computer Science from the University of Delhi. My recent intrests have aligned towards researching about machine learning and deep learning algorithms and getting into the field of AI. In past, I've worked on (SMP-scale) blockchain-based and web development projects. **I like Vanilla-libraries on multiple DBs concurrently, you know.**

# ls -al

I am another Computer Science passout from a prominent public school of New Delhi, India. My school was one of the most prestigious institution in the city with at-least one student among the national toppers would be from our school every year, every damn year. Great track record you see. Yet, I fail to keep the same marks-projects relationship/balance in the college. Wandering around 75% in college from 95% in school was a steep learning curve for me all I can say, modestly.  

# grep -r "New Research Oppurtunities"

Due to my recent alignment and inclination towards research, I think I'd opt for a doctoral programme in technical research either in machine learning or decentralized systems. However, I do look out for new research oppurtunites in my technical domain of expertise. No, not like anyone else, even if I'd have to relocate somewhere while my classes commences at college and have to, in result, leave graduation in pursuit of better learning experience, I'd happily opt for and do that, but only after spending 40+ hours in quarrel with my parents, however.

# abrakadabra [OPTIONS] [COMMAND]

I've a sort of deep love to build command-line interfaces. My last project took me 50+ days in development, with commit cycles ranging from over 5 commits per day. It was simplistic and minimal terminal-based text editor written in C and C++, which I called [CEdit](https://github.com/sambhav2612/CEdit). Just like nano, but sort of less, you know.

My recent pursuit include a CPP client for Fuck Of As A Service API and an awesome list for great links for developer projects in general, irrespective of language, stack, color or race.

One more thing I like to create cringe-worthy developer memes, heh.
